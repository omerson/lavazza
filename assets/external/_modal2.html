                    <p>
                                                                          We have existed for quite a long time. Few people know that the phrase 'eyefull' was coined in the cafe of the same name in Ruzveltova street.      <br/>
                                                    <br/>
This is where we started and then we opened the old Ceger in the beginning of Save Kovacevica street. 
Because we love heroes. Now we are in Skerliceva, next to the temple and the library, still in great company.
     <br/>
                                                    <br/>
In the "Oko" (eye) which is always full, also in the old Ceger as well as in the new one, since the day we opened until today. People know what's good.
     <br/>
                                                    <br/>
We've changed locations, but not our crew.
     <br/>
                                                    <br/>
Only two people come to us: guests and friends. Well, new guests and old friends - welcome!
     <br/>
                                                    <br/>
We’ve concluded that café Ceger is a place for smart people, who are smarter than their smartphones. 
They keep those in their pockets because having smart conversation with their smart friends at the same table is more important.
     <br/>
                                                    <br/>
We work to make sure that there’s always a great crowd in café Ceger, to make sure that the food is even better and that the drinks are best of all!
     <br/>
                                                    <br/>
We would like to become your second home forever – but in the first place in your heart!
     <br/>
                                                    <br/>

Enough about us, let’s hear about you: So, how are you today?
